Software | Directories there

currently working on:
debugging breadcrumbs located in software,
and the Spanish and English buttons.

The Live environment is working fine,
when I tested in another environment that resembled the production server,
the page was breaking, due to the header() calls.

Right now I will continue to develop in the live environment,
hoping that I can fix these issues in production.
