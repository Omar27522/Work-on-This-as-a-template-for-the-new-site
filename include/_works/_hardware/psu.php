        <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Computer_power_supply_unit_manufacturers"
                class="psu">Popular PSU Manufacturers</a></h2>
        <p>Desktop computers require a power supply unit (PSU) to convert AC power from the wall outlet into DC power
            that can be used by the computer&#39;s internal components. A desktop computer PSU typically ranges in power
            output from 300 to 1200 watts, with the most common wattages being between 400 and 800 watts. The wattage
            needed for a desktop computer PSU is determined by the power requirements of the internal components,
            including the CPU, GPU, hard drives, water pumps, radiators, fans and any additional hardware such as a
            sound card or optical drives.</p><img src="https://latinospc.com/images/hardware/hw/psu.jpg" class="fl">
        <p>When choosing a PSU for a desktop computer, it is important to ensure that it has the necessary wattage to
            power all of the components in the system, while also providing enough headroom for future upgrades. A PSU
            that is too weak for the system can cause stability issues or even damage to the hardware, while a PSU that
            is too powerful may waste energy and be more expensive than necessary.</p>
        <img src="https://latinospc.com/images/hardware/hw/psu2.png" class="rtl">
        <h2>PSUs are typically rated for efficiency using the 80 Plus<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80_Plus"
                title="80 Plus"> certification system</a>, which ranges from 80 Plus (basic efficiency) to 80 Plus
            Titanium (highest efficiency). A more efficient PSU will waste less energy as heat and will result in lower
            electricity bills over time.</h2>

    <article class="fullbar article">
        <p><strong class="psu">Power Adapters for Laptops:</strong> Laptops, on the other hand, typically do not have an
            internal PSU. Instead, they use a power adapter (brick) that converts AC power from the wall outlet into DC
            power that can be used by the laptop. Laptop power adapters are typically rated for output voltage and
            amperage, and are designed to provide the specific voltage and amperage required by the laptop&#39;s
            internal components.</p>
        <img src="https://latinospc.com/images/hardware/hw/portablepower.png" class="rtl">
        <p>When choosing a power adapter for a laptop, it is important to ensure that it provides the correct voltage
            and amperage, as using an adapter with the wrong specifications can damage the laptop&#39;s internal
            components. It is also important to choose an adapter that is compatible with the laptop&#39;s charging
            port.</p><img src="https://latinospc.com/images/hardware/hw/slimpower.png" class="fl">
        <p>Laptop power adapters come in a variety of sizes and shapes, with some designed for travel and others for use
            at a desk. Some adapters also include additional features, such as the ability to charge multiple devices at
            once or the ability to adjust the output voltage to support a wider range of devices.</p>
        <div class="spacer_shape">
            <p>In conclusion, power supplies are an essential component of any computing system, whether it&#39;s a
                desktop computer or a laptop. When choosing a power supply, it is important to ensure that it provides
                the necessary wattage or specifications to power all of the internal components, while also being
                efficient and compatible with the system.</p>
