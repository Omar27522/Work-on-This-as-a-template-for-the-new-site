                The main difference between an SSD and a Hard Disk Drive (HDD - shown above); is that the SSD doesn't
                have any moving parts and because of it, it makes reading and writing data much faster than a mechanical
                HDD, which has spinning platters. The platters work alongside an actuator arm that has a slider, think
                of it like a record player from back in the day.

                capacity of 32GB, sequential read/write speeds of 57 MB/s and 32 MB/s respectively and a hefty price tag
                of around $1000.

                An SSD speed is about 550 megabytes per second read and write speeds. An SSD is 410+ megabytes per
                second faster than a HDD.

                Lets say your computer took one minute to be usable from when you first pressed the power button, now it
                takes thirty seconds, and when you transfer data on it, like from your phone, or an external hard drive
                is now much faster.

                An SSD supports more I/O operations, has a lower latency than HDD, and are "faster", smaller, more
                portable, more resistant to damage, and less affected by magnets than HDDs.
            </h2>
            <p>
                The traditional spinning HDD is the basic non-volatile storage on a computer.
                <br /><img src="http://latinospc.com/images/hardware/hw/hdd.jpg" width="380px" class="rtl">
                That is, information on it does not “go away” when you turn off the system, unlike data stored in RAM.
                An HDD is essentially a metal platter with a magnetic coating that stores your data.<div
                    style="text-indent: 25px;">
                    A read/write head on an arm (or a set of them) accesses the data while the platters are spinning.
                </div>
                An SSD performs the same basic function as a HDD, but data is instead stored on interconnected
                flash-memory chips that retain the data even when there is no power flowing through them.
                These flash chips (often dubbed “NAND”) are of a different type than the kind used in USB thumb drives,
                and are typically faster and more reliable.
                <div style="text-indent: 25px;">
                    The key differences between HDDs and SSDs are that SSDs are faster, more reliable, and more
                    expensive than HDDs. HDDs are cheaper and have more storage space than SSDs.

                Once upon a time, magnetic storage was the only way to store data on computers. It was a revolutionary
                technology that allowed people to store large amounts of data in a small space. The first magnetic
                storage device was invented in 1956 by IBM and it was called the

            <h2>
                Magnetic storage devices were used for many years and they continued to improve over time.</h2>
            <p>Computer storage devices became smaller, faster, and more reliable. However, they had their limitations.
                They were prone to failure due to their mechanical nature and they were not very fast compared to other
                types of storage devices.
                Solid state drives (SSDs) were invented over half a century ago and then made widely commercially
                available. <br />They use non-volatile solid state chips that feature flash memory cells to store data
                on a long-term basis. Unlike traditional hard disk drives (HDDs), which use magnetic platters spinning
                at high speeds to using an actuator arm reminiscent of a record player, SSDs require no moving parts.
                <div style="text-indent: 25px;">
                    This makes them much faster at reading and writing data, both ad hoc and in sustained operations.
                    SSDs also have built-in technology that further improves read/write speeds, making them faster than
                    traditional HDDs.</div>
                SSDs are also more reliable than traditional HDDs (from a mechanical and data integrity standpoint).
                They do not require an additional power source that maintains an electrical current into the device at
                all times to preserve the data. This makes them increasingly more reliable than traditional HDDs.

                The cost of SSDs has come down significantly over the years as well. They are now much more affordable
                than they used to be. The storage sizes have also increased significantly over time. Today&apos;s SSDs
                can store up to several terabytes of data.

        <h2>How to Pick an SSD for your computer</h2>
        <p>Choosing the best SSD for your computer depends on several factors, including your specific requirements,
            budget, and compatibility with your system.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that the best SSD for your system depends on an specific use case. For general productivity and
            gaming, a mid-range NVMe SSD with ample capacity is often a good choice. When more performance is required
            for intensive tasks like video editing or professional applications, it is worth it to consider a high-end
            NVMe SSDs.</p>
        <h2>Selecting, and, or upgrading to an SSD:</h2>
        <div>
            <strong class="ssd">Form Factor:</strong> SSDs come in various form factors, such as 2.5-inch, M.2, and U.2.
            Ensure that the SSD you choose is compatible with your computer's available slots and connections.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Interface:</strong> The most common interfaces for consumer SSDs are SATA
            (for 2.5-inch drives) and NVMe (for M.2 and U.2 drives). NVMe offers faster speeds than SATA, so if your
            computer supports NVMe, it's generally a better choice for better performance.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Capacity:</strong> Determine how much storage you need. SSDs are available
            in different capacities, ranging from 128GB to several terabytes. Consider your current and future storage
            needs before deciding.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Performance:</strong> Look at the SSD's read and write speeds. NVMe SSDs
            generally have faster speeds than SATA SSDs, resulting in quicker boot times and faster file transfers.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Endurance:</strong> Check the TBW (Total Bytes Written) or DWPD (Drive
            Writes Per Day) rating to understand the SSD's endurance and expected lifespan, especially if you plan on
            performing a lot of read/write operations.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Cache:</strong> Some SSDs have cache memory to improve performance. A larger
            cache can positively impact the SSD's speed.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Brand and Reliability:</strong> Stick to well-known and reputable brands
            that have a history of producing reliable SSDs.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Price:</strong> Compare prices from different manufacturers and retailers,
            considering your budget and the overall value you get from the SSD.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Warranty:</strong> Check the warranty period offered by the manufacturer. A
            longer warranty generally indicates the company's confidence in the SSD's reliability.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Compatibility:</strong> Ensure that the SSD is compatible with your
            computer's operating system and hardware. Check for driver support if required.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Read Reviews:</strong> Read user and expert reviews to gain insights into
            real-world performance and reliability.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Data Migration:</strong> If you're replacing your existing hard drive with
            an SSD, check if the manufacturer provides data migration software or consider using third-party tools to
            clone your data to the new SSD.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">TRIM Support:</strong> TRIM is a feature that helps maintain SSD performance
            over time. Ensure that your operating system and SSD support TRIM.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Overprovisioning:</strong> Some SSDs come with overprovisioning, which
            reserves a portion of the storage for background tasks to enhance performance and longevity.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Security:</strong> If data security is a concern, look for SSDs that offer
            hardware-based encryption and security features.
