    <p tabindex="0" class="sub_title center card2 selection" style="text-align: center;">Anti-Slip Mats: Overview</p>

    <p class="sub_sub_title selection" tabindex="0">Anti-slip mats are designed to prevent items from sliding or
        slipping on a surface.<br /><br />
        They are commonly used in various applications, including under computer peripherals such as keyboards, mice,
        laptops, and desktop computers.<br /><br />
        The primary purpose of using anti-slip mats for computers is to enhance stability and prevent accidental
        movement, which can improve user comfort and productivity.</p>
