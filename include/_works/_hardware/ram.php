        <h3>The most common RAM sizes for consumer PCs are <b>8GB</b> and <b>16GB</b>. These are sizes that typically
            are found in new
            computers, also 8 or 16 is
            sufficient for most tasks, such as web browsing, office work, media playback. And impressively the work gets
            done because of
            <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/performance/ram-virtual-memory-pagefile-management"
                title="Virtual Ram">
                vr</a>, the only downside is the slower overall computer speed with memory intensive applications that
            require more memory.
        </h3>
        <h2>Some higher-end consumer PCs may come with 32GB, 64GB of RAM or more.</h2>
        <h3>In terms of configurations, consumer PCs typically use DDR4/5 memory, which is the most widely used type of
            RAM.
            Some older PCs may still use DDR3/2 memory, but this is becoming less common. Additionally, most consumer
            PCs use non-ECC
            <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ecc-memory-ram-glossary-definition,6013.html">(Error-Correction
                Code)</a>
            memory, which is less expensive and doesn't provide the same level of data protection as ECC memory.
            The actual speed of the RAM can vary depending on the specific
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit" title="Integrated circuit">ICs</a> and the
            motherboard's memory controllers.
            Say a baseboard only supports upto a certain speed of memory.(eg. 4GB) even after adding more (+2GB) the
            computer
            might not recognize the extra ram.<br />[4+2=6, but the maximum allowed is 4, so even with 6gb of memory,
            the computer will only have a total of 4gb.]Also, the benefit of faster RAM speed depends on the usage,
            scenario,
            and the specific application; in most cases, applications and games may not be able to take full advantage
            of the faster memory,
            but if you are doing memory-intensive tasks such as video editing, 3D rendering, or running a lot of virtual
            machines, faster RAM can provide a
            significant performance boost. <b>Note that capacity is not the same as speed</b>

        <h2>RAM attachments:</h2>
        <h3>These are additional components that can be added to a computer's RAM to enhance its performance or
            appearance.
            Some popular examples include RAM coolers, which are designed to dissipate heat and keep the memory modules
            cool, and RAM fans,
            which actively cool the memory modules using airflow. RAM lighting, such as RGB lighting, adds a visual
            element to the memory
            modules by illuminating them with different colors. (<a

            fast)
            RAM <b>coolers</b> are typically made of aluminum or other heat-dissipating materials and are designed to be
            attached directly to the
            memory modules, often with thermal pads or thermal tape. They can help to reduce the temperature of the
            memory modules, which
            can improve their performance and stability.RAM <b>fans</b> are similar to CPU fans, they are small and can
            be placed on top of the memory
            modules to improve the airflow and dissipate heat.RAM <b>lighting</b>, such as RGB lighting, is becoming
            more popular
            and can be found in many modern motherboards. It adds a visual element to the memory modules and can be
            controlled
            through software to match the color scheme of the build.</h3>
        <h2>It is important to note that while these attachments
            can enhance the performance or appearance of the memory,they are not necessary for most users, and are
            mostly used for enthusiasts or gamers.</h2><br />
