    </h3><img src="../images/artificialintelligence/hw/display/thumbs/ultrahd.jpg" class="rtl">
    <h2>
        4. High Dynamic Range (HDR):
    </h2>
    <h3>
        HDR is a technology that expands the range of colors and contrast in a display. It allows for brighter whites,
        deeper blacks, and a wider color gamut, resulting in a more vibrant and lifelike image.
    </h3>
    <h2>
        5. OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode):
    </h2>
    <h3>
        OLED technology utilizes organic compounds that emit light when an electric current is applied. OLED displays
        offer deep blacks, high contrast ratios, wide viewing angles, and vibrant colors. They are known for their thin
        form factor and excellent picture quality.
    </h3>
    <h2>
        6. Quantum Dot:
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Quantum Dot technology involves using tiny semiconductor particles (quantum dots) to enhance color reproduction
        and brightness in displays. Quantum Dot displays can achieve a wider color gamut, resulting in more accurate and
        vibrant colors.

        viewing angles, ensuring consistent colors and contrast even when viewed from different positions.
    </h3>
    <h2>
        9. MicroLED:
    </h2>
    <h3>
        MicroLED is an emerging display technology that uses tiny LED modules to create images. It offers the benefits
        of OLED, such as deep blacks and high contrast, but with potentially higher brightness levels and longer
        lifespan.
    </h3>
    <h2>
        10. Local Dimming:
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Local dimming is a backlighting technique used in LCD displays to enhance contrast. It selectively dims or
        brightens different areas of the backlight to improve black levels and overall picture quality.
