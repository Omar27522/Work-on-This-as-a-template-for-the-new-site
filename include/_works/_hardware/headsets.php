    <section class="centercenter">They are devices that create a virtual reality for the user, by blocking out the real world and replacing it with a digital environment.
    VR headsets usually have screens that cover the eyes, headphones that cover the ears, and sensors that track the user's head and body movements.
    Some VR headsets also have controllers that allow the user to interact with the virtual world.</section>
</fieldset>

<fieldset><legend class="card2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">AR</a> headsets</legend><a rel="example_group" href="../images/hardware/hw/headsets/ar.jpg" title="Augmented Reality headsets"><img src="../images/hardware/hw/headsets/ar.webp" alt="Augmented Reality headsets" class="rtl"></a>
    <section class="centercenter2">Devices that augment the real world with digital information, by overlaying images, sounds, or texts on top of what the user sees.
    AR headsets usually have transparent lenses or glasses that let the user see through them, speakers or earbuds that let the user hear sounds, and cameras or sensors that track the user's eye and head movements.
    Some AR headsets also have microphones or touch-pads that allow the user to communicate with the digital information.</section>
</fieldset>
<fieldset><legend class="card2">VR headsets and AR headsets</legend>Currently they both have different applications and advantages.<br />
    <strong>VR</strong> headsets are ideal for immersive gaming, entertainment, education, and training, as they can transport the user to any place or time they want.<br />
    <strong>AR</strong> headsets are ideal for enhancing productivity, communication, navigation, and accessibility, as they can provide useful information or assistance to the user in any situation.
<p class="big arvr" tabindex="0">
They also both have different challenges and limitations.<br />
<em>VR</em> headsets require a lot of processing power and battery life, as they have to render complex graphics and sounds in real time.<br />
They also can cause motion sickness, eye strain, or disorientation for some users, as they disconnect them from their physical surroundings.<br />
<em>AR</em> headsets require a lot of accuracy and stability, as they have to align the digital information with the real world.<br />
They also can cause privacy, security, or ethical issues for some users, as they collect and display personal or sensitive data.
</p></fieldset>

<fieldset><legend class="card2">VR vs AR</legend>
To illustrate the differences between VR headsets and AR headsets, here's a poem I wrote: (Bing Chat - 8/23/2023)


<pre class="colms2 poem">
VR is like a dream
That takes you far away
To places you've never seen
Or worlds you want to stay

AR is like a friend
That stays by your side
To help you comprehend
Or guide you when you're lost

VR is like a magic
That transforms your reality
To fantasies you can pick
Or stories you can be

AR is like a tool
That enhances your reality
To facts you can use
Or tasks you can do

VR is like a wonder
That fills you with awe
To marvels you can discover
Or mysteries you can solve

AR is like a mirror
That reflects your reality
To insights you can learn
Or feedback you can get

VR is like an escape
That frees you from your limits
To adventures you can shape
Or challenges you can face

AR is like an extension
That connects you to your world
To people you can interact
Or things you can control
