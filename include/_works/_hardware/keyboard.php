    Overview
</h2>
<h3>
    The mechanical typewriter invented by Christopher Latham Sholes in the late 1800s, was a revolutionary device that
    could imprint letters on paper with the touch of a key, replacing the laborious task of handwriting.
</h3>
<h3>
    However, the original QWERTY keyboard layout that Sholes came up with had some flaws. The keys were arranged in a
    way that made typing fast difficult, as the most commonly used letters were placed far apart. The result was that
    typists would often jam the keys, causing the typewriter to stop working.
</h3>
<h3>
    In the early 1900s, another inventor named August Dvorak decided to solve this problem by creating a new keyboard
    layout that would make typing more efficient. His design placed the most frequently used letters in the middle row
    and arranged the keys so that the fingers would move less, reducing fatigue and increasing speed. This layout became
    known as the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard.</h3>
<h3>
    Despite its benefits, the Dvorak keyboard didn&#39;t catch on immediately. The QWERTY keyboard had already become
    standard, and it was difficult to convince people to switch to a new system. However, some enthusiasts continued to
    promote the Dvorak keyboard, arguing that it was more comfortable and efficient.</h3>
<h3>
    Today, electronic keyboards have replaced the old mechanical typewriters, and both QWERTY and Dvorak layouts are
    still in use. Some people even create their own custom keyboard layouts, using the latest technology to design
    keyboards that fit their individual needs.
</h3>
<h3>
    And so the story of the keyboard continues, evolving and adapting to the needs of each generation. Who knows what
    new innovations and designs we will see in the future?

    Features
</h2>
<h2>
    Keyboards come in many different shapes and sizes, with a variety of features that can make them unique and
    specialized for different purposes. Here are some examples of unique features you might find on keyboards:
</h2>
<ol>
    <h3>
        <li>
            <b class="items">Mechanical switches:</b>
            These are switches that use a physical mechanism to activate each key press, resulting in a tactile feel and
            an audible clicking sound. Mechanical keyboards are popular among gamers and typists who value the tactile
            feedback and durability of the switches.
        </li>
    </h3>
    <li>
        <h3><b class="items">Backlit keys:</b>
            Some keyboards have keys that are illuminated, making them easier to see in low light conditions. This
            feature is particularly useful for gamers and those who work in dimly lit environments.
        </h3>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3><b class="items">Programmable keys:</b>
            Some keyboards have programmable keys that can be customized to perform specific functions or launch
            applications with a single press. This can be a time-saving feature for users who frequently perform certain
            tasks or use certain applications.
        </h3>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3><b class="items">Ergonomic design:</b>
            Keyboards with an ergonomic design are designed to reduce strain and discomfort on the hands and wrists,
            particularly for users who spend long hours typing. They may have a curved shape, a split design, or other
            features to promote more comfortable typing.
        </h3>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3><b class="items">Wireless connectivity:</b>
            Some keyboards connect to a computer or other device wirelessly, using Bluetooth or other wireless
            protocols. This can be a convenient feature for users who prefer to work without cords and cables.
        </h3>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3><b class="items">Touchpads or trackballs:</b>
            Some keyboards feature built-in touchpads or trackballs, allowing users to control the cursor without using
            a separate mouse. This can be a useful feature for users who prefer to work with minimal desk space.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2> These are just a few examples of the many unique features that keyboards can offer. Whether you&#39;re a gamer, a
    typist, or a casual computer user, there&#39;s sure to be a keyboard out there with the features and design that
    best suit your needs.

<h1 style="line-height:1.44;margin-top:6pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Keyboards can be highly collectible for several reasons.
</h1>
<h2>
    Overall, the reasons for keyboard collectibility can vary widely, but the combination of historical significance,
    rarity, design, customization, and nostalgia can all contribute to making certain keyboards highly sought after by
    enthusiasts and collectors.
</h2>
<h3><b class="items">Historical significance:</b>
    Some keyboards have a significant historical or cultural value, either because of their design, their role in
    technological innovation, or their association with a famous user or event. For example, the Apple Extended Keyboard
    II, which was released in 1990, is highly sought after by collectors for its iconic design and its association with
    early Apple computers.
    <br /><br /><b class="items">Rarity:</b>
    Some keyboards are rare or limited edition, making them highly collectible. This might be because they were produced
    in small quantities, were only sold in certain regions, or were only available for a short period of time.
    <br /><br /><b class="items">Design:</b>
    Keyboards can be highly collectible for their design, whether it&#39;s because of their aesthetics, their ergonomic
    features, or their unique functionality. For example, the Happy Hacking Keyboard, which was designed in Japan in the
    early 2000s, has a minimalist design and a compact layout that has won it a devoted following among keyboard
    enthusiasts.
    <br /><br /><b class="items">Customization:</b>
    Some collectors are drawn to keyboards that have been customized or modified by their previous owners, whether
    it&#39;s through the addition of custom keycaps, the installation of a new switch mechanism, or other modifications.
    <br /><br /><b class="items">Nostalgia:</b>
    Some collectors may be drawn to keyboards that remind them of their youth or of a particular era in computing
    history. For example, the IBM Model M keyboard, which was produced in the 1980s and 1990s, is prized by many
    collectors for its distinctive buckling spring switches and its association with early IBM computers.
</h3>
