   <p class="sub_title">The history of pencils is quite fascinating and spans several centuries.</p>
   <p class="sub_title">Pencils have played a crucial role in the world of writing and drawing, and their evolution has been marked by significant technological advancements and artistic contributions.</p>
   <p class="sub_title">Here's a brief overview of the history of pencils:</p>
<section>
<div class="blurb">
   <span>1. Ancient Beginnings:</span>
<div class="colms">
<p>The precursor to modern pencils can be traced back to ancient civilizations like the Egyptians and Romans.</p>
<p>They used a thin metal or lead stylus to etch marks onto papyrus or wax tablets.</p>
<p>However, these early tools were not as versatile or practical as modern pencils.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="blurb">
   <span>2. Discovery of Graphite:</span>
<div class="colms2">
<p>The breakthrough in pencil history came in the late 16th century when a large deposit of graphite,
      a naturally occurring form of carbon, was discovered in Borrowdale, England.</p>
<p class="spacio">This graphite was initially used to mark sheep, but people soon realized its potential for writing due to its smooth and dark marks.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="blurb">
   <span>3. Early Pencil Innovations:</span>
<div class="colms">
<p>In the 17th century, craftsmen began encasing graphite in various materials, such as string, leather, and paper.</p>
<p>The first recognizable pencil was invented in the early 18th century when the German-Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner encased graphite sticks in a wooden holder.</p>
<p>However, these early pencils were still quite crude and fragile.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="blurb">
   <span>4. Harder Lead Pencils:</span>
   <div class="colms">
<p>The English chemist Joseph Priestley further improved pencil technology in the late 18th century.</p>
<p>He found that by mixing powdered graphite with clay, he could create a harder and more durable lead.</p>
<p>This paved the way for the development of modern pencils.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="blurb">
   <span>5. Industrial Revolution:</span>
   <div class="colms2">
<p>The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century led to mass production of pencils.</p>
<hr>
<p class="spacio">Innovations in manufacturing techniques, such as the use of machinery for cutting wood and molding graphite cores, made pencils more affordable and widely accessible.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="blurb">
<span>6. Erasers:</span>
<div class="colms2">
<p>In the early 19th century, a mistake-correcting innovation was introduced when an English
   engineer named Edward Nairne attached a piece of natural rubber to the end of a pencil.</p>
<p class="spacio">This marked the birth of the eraser-tipped pencil, which quickly became popular.</p>
<hr>
</div></div>

<div class="blurb">
   <span>7. Mechanical Pencils:</span>
<div class="colms2">
<p>The mid-19th century saw the invention of the mechanical pencil.</p>
<hr>
<p class="spacio">These pencils featured a retractable lead mechanism, allowing writers and artists to extend the lead as it wore down, eliminating the need for constant sharpening.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="blurb">
   <span>8. Graphite Grading Scale:</span>
<div class="colms2">
<p>In the early 20th century, the graphite grading scale was developed, categorizing pencils into different levels of hardness and darkness.</p>
<p>This standardized system helped artists and writers choose the appropriate pencil for their needs.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="blurb">
<span>9. Contemporary Pencils:</span>
<div class="colms2">
<p>Today's pencils come in a variety of designs, including traditional wooden pencils, mechanical pencils, and specialty pencils for specific artistic applications.</p>
<p class="spacio">The core formula and manufacturing processes have been refined over time, resulting in high-quality, versatile writing and drawing tools.</p>
</div></div>

   <p class="sub_title">The history of writing pens is just as intriguing as that of pencils.</p><hr>
   <p class="sub_title">Writing pens have undergone significant transformations over the centuries, from simple quills to the advanced fountain pens and modern ballpoint pens we use today.</p><hr>
   <p class="sub_title">Here's a brief overview of the history of writing pens:</p><hr>
</div>
<div class="spacer"></div>

<div class="colms">

   <fieldset class="blurb">
      <legend>Ancient Writing Instruments:</legend>
      <p>Before the invention of pens, people used a variety of tools to write, including reeds, brushes, and quills made from feathers.</p>
      <p>These instruments were often dipped in ink and then used to create marks on surfaces like parchment or paper.</p>
      </fieldset>

      <fieldset class="blurb">
      <legend>Quill Pens:</legend>
      <p>Quill pens, made from the feathers of birds like geese or swans, were a significant development in writing technology.</p>
      <p>The hard shaft of the feather served as the nib, while the hollow structure helped hold and deliver ink.</p>
      <p>Quill pens gained popularity in the Middle Ages and were used for centuries by scholars, scribes, and writers.</p>
      </fieldset>

      <fieldset class="blurb">
      <legend>Steel Pens:</legend>
      <p>The early 19th century witnessed the rise of steel pens, which were sturdier and more durable than quills.</p>
      <p>The metal nibs were fitted into wooden or metal holders.</p>
      <p>These pens were particularly favored for their consistency in writing and were a precursor to modern fountain pens.</p>
      </fieldset>
</div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="colms">
      <fieldset class="blurb">
      <legend>Fountain Pens:</legend>
      <p>The fountain pen, as we know it today, started to take shape in the 19th century. The first practical fountain pen was patented by Petrache Poenaru in 1827. However, it was Lewis Waterman's invention in the late 1880s that successfully addressed issues of ink flow and leakage, making fountain pens more reliable and convenient.</p>
      </fieldset>

      <fieldset class="blurb">
      <legend>Ballpoint Pens:</legend>
      <p>The mid-20th century brought about a revolutionary change in writing technology with the invention of the ballpoint pen. László Bíró and his brother Georg patented the first commercially successful ballpoint pen design in 1938. These pens used a tiny ball in the tip that rotated and picked up ink from a reservoir, providing a smoother writing experience and avoiding ink spillage.</p>
      </fieldset>

      <fieldset class="blurb">
      <legend>Rollerball Pens:</legend>
      <p>A variation of the ballpoint pen, the rollerball pen, gained popularity in the 1970s. Rollerball pens used water-based ink that flowed more smoothly and offered a different writing experience compared to traditional ballpoint pens.</p>
      </fieldset>
</div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="colms">
      <fieldset class="blurb">
      <legend>Gel Pens:</legend>
      <p>Gel pens emerged in the 1980s, combining the characteristics of ballpoint and rollerball pens. They used gel-based ink that offered vibrant colors and a smooth writing feel.</p>
      </fieldset>

      <fieldset class="blurb">
      <legend>Modern Advancements:</legend>
      <p>In recent decades, pens have continued to evolve with various features and innovations. These include ergonomic designs for comfort during extended writing sessions, hybrid ink pens that combine the benefits of gel and ballpoint inks, and smart pens that can digitize handwritten notes.</p>
      </fieldset>

      <fieldset class="blurb">
      <legend>Personalization and Collectibles:</legend>
      <p>Pens have become not only functional writing instruments but also status symbols and collectible items. High-end pen manufacturers produce limited-edition and luxury pens that feature intricate designs, precious metals, and gemstones.</p>
