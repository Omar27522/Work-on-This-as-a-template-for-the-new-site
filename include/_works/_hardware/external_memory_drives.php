    <h3 class="container"><a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/portable_storage_device">Portable memory</a> for
        computer users typically comes in the form of external <a href="../hardware/?ssd#ssd">hard drives or solid-state

        <h3>In terms of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_enclosure">housing of the drive</a>, there are a

            is durable and can withstand being transported frequently. Some external hard drives come with <a
                href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-rugged-hard-drives-and-ssds">shock-resistant casings</a>,
            which can help protect the drive from accidental drops or bumps.<br /><a

            frequently.</h3>

        <h3><span style="font-size: large;">Another consideration</span> when choosing an external hard drive or SSD is
            the <a href="https://tripplite.eaton.com/products/usb-connectivity-types-standards">interface</a> it uses to
            connect to your computer. USB 3.0 and USB-C are popular interfaces for external hard drives and SSDs, as

            USB</a> or one that requires an external power source. USB-powered devices can be more convenient to use, as
        you don&#39;t need to carry around a separate power supply, but they may not be suitable for all use cases,
        especially if you need to transfer large amounts of data quickly.</h3>
