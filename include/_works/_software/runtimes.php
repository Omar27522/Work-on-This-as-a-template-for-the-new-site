                    <li>The recipe <strong>(program code)</strong> tells what needs to be done</li>
                    <li>The ingredients <strong>(data)</strong> are what you're working with</li>
                    <li>The kitchen tools <strong>(system resources)</strong> help get the job done</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Just like a kitchen needs all these elements working together to serve a meal, your apps need runtime
                    to function!</p>

                <h2>How Does Runtime Work?</h2>
                <p>Every <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_programming_languages#Current_trends">programming
                        language</a>
                    needs its own special runtime environment. Think of it as different types of kitchens - a sushi
                    restaurant needs
                    different tools than a pizzeria, but they both make delicious food!</p>

                <div class="fun-fact">
                    <h3>üåü Fun Fact:</h3>
                    <p>When you're playing a mobile game, the runtime is handling millions of tiny tasks every second -
                        from making
                        sure your character jumps when you tap, to keeping track of your score, all while making sure
                        your phone's
                        battery isn't drained too quickly!</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Why Some Apps Run Better Than Others</h2>
                <h3>1. App Complexity</h3>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>Simple apps (like a calculator) are like making toast - quick and easy. Complex games are like
                        preparing a
                        five-course meal - they need more time and resources!</p>
                </div>

                <h3>2. Your Device's Power</h3>
                <p>Different devices have different capabilities:</p>
                <ul class="device-list">
                    <li>üñ•Ô∏è <strong>Desktop Computers:</strong> Like a professional kitchen - lots of power and space
                    </li>
                    <li>üíª <strong>Laptops:</strong> Like a home kitchen - good for most tasks</li>
                    <li>üì± <strong>Mobile Devices:</strong> Like a food truck kitchen - smaller but surprisingly
                        capable!</li>
                </ul>
