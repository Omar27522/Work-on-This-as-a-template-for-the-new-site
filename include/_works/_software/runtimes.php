                <p style="font-size: 14px;">Ever wondered why some apps run smoothly while others feel sluggish? Or why the same game might run perfectly 
                on your friend's phone but struggle on yours? The answer lies in something called "runtime" - the invisible 
                conductor orchestrating everything your apps do.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>What is Runtime? Think of it as a Kitchen</h2>
            <p>Imagine your computer as a busy restaurant kitchen:</p>
            <ul class="kitchen-analogy">
                <li>The <strong>chef (runtime environment)</strong> coordinates everything</li>
                <li>The <strong>recipe (program code)</strong> tells what needs to be done</li>
                <li>The <strong>ingredients (data)</strong> are what you're working with</li>
                <li>The <strong>kitchen tools (system resources)</strong> help get the job done</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Just like a kitchen needs all these elements working together to serve a meal, your apps need runtime to function!</p>

            <h2>How Does Runtime Work?</h2>
            <p>Every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_programming_languages#Current_trends">programming language</a> 
            needs its own special runtime environment. Think of it as different types of kitchens - a sushi restaurant needs 
            different tools than a pizzeria, but they both make delicious food!</p>
            
            <div class="fun-fact">
                <h3>üåü Fun Fact:</h3>
                <p>When you're playing a mobile game, the runtime is handling millions of tiny tasks every second - from making 
                sure your character jumps when you tap, to keeping track of your score, all while making sure your phone's 
                battery isn't drained too quickly!</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Why Some Apps Run Better Than Others</h2>
            <h3>1. App Complexity</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>Simple apps (like a calculator) are like making toast - quick and easy. Complex games are like preparing a 
                five-course meal - they need more time and resources!</p>
            </div>

            <h3>2. Your Device's Power</h3>
            <p>Different devices have different capabilities:</p>
            <ul class="device-list">
                <li>üñ•Ô∏è <strong>Desktop Computers:</strong> Like a professional kitchen - lots of power and space</li>
                <li>üíª <strong>Laptops:</strong> Like a home kitchen - good for most tasks</li>
                <li>üì± <strong>Mobile Devices:</strong> Like a food truck kitchen - smaller but surprisingly capable!</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="future-section">
                <h3>üöÄ The Future is Exciting!</h3>
                <p>Technology keeps getting better - imagine having the power of today's desktop computer in tomorrow's 
                smartwatch! Companies like Apple, AMD, and Intel are constantly developing new ways to pack more processing 
                power into smaller spaces.</p>
