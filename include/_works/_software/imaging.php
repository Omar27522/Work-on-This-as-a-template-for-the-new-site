    <h2>Humans have senses to measure the enviroment they are in.</h2>
    <p>One of these senses is <b><u>sight</u></b>. When light bounces off an object, human eyes detect the variations of
        these light bounces; then our brain makes the necessary calculations to represent it in the natural world,
        A.K.A. reality. In other words if the object is there and you are seeing it then you can test the reality of
        said object by measuring it with other senses</p>
    <h3>Unfortunatelly imaging in computers can only be 2 dimensional.</h3> The computer makes the necessary
    calculations to represent or display an image in this 2 dimensional world. <p>Imaging in this context is the format
        on which image files are created. Also now days computers, are able to create objects from the 2D computer world
        on to our three dimensional one, via <a href="https://all3dp.com/2/3d-file-format-3d-model-types/">3D Printers.
