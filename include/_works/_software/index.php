$description=['<p>Like paper
            programs, (which we get before the start of performances, like Concert Shows, a Graduation or Stage Plays.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>Software</strong> are a way to communicate to the computer user, about the computer’s ongoing performances.<br />
            Computer software, like paper programs could be considered the same idea in this instance. Much more
            different than paper programs, <ins>software</ins> contains all the necessary parts that make the whole
            show.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">The “stage” is the CPU,Ram,Hard drive.<br />
            The public enjoys the performance through the computer display, the performers are the programs
            themselves.</p>
            <p>Because computers can execute muti-millions of instructions per second; millions+ of performers and
            performances have to be coordinated in a way that makes the computer <b>run</b> without declaring any
            software errors, glitches, bugs, or unwanted features.)</p>'];
