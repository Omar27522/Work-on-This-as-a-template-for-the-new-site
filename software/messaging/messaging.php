        'From the dawn of human civilization, the need to communicate has driven countless innovations. As societies evolved, so did their methods of communication, transitioning from smoke signals and carrier pigeons to telegraphs and telephones. With the advent of the internet in the late 20th century, a new era of instantaneous, global communication was born. <a href="https://www.scicommcollective.com/articles/sccsymposium/communicationmedia" style="padding-left:200px;" title="Science Communication Through Art: The Universal Language">Communication</a>',
        'Aside from email, we can communicate instantaneously over the internet using a messaging program (APP), now days we can send attached video files, pictures, links and attachments over these apps. Most modern messaging applications offer private group chats, video/voice calling the person(s), make and accept payments, and of course, play games.',
        '"<i>Though the term dates from the 1990s, instant messaging predates the Internet, first appearing on multi-user operating systems like Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) and Multiplexed Information and Computing Service (Multics)[12][13] in the mid-1960s. Initially, some of these systems were used as notification systems for services like printing, but quickly were used to facilitate communication with other users logged into the same machine. CTSS facilitated communication via text message for up to 30 people.[14] </i>"'
