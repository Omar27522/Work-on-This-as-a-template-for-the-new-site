Current Stage: Where will backups go?

Project Overview

This project focuses on refactoring the existing website codebase. Here's a breakdown of the key areas:

Directory Structure: The website utilizes directories to organize content. Each directory represents a location within the site (e.g., /contact).

File Management: There are two main file types: code and content. Each directory houses an index.php file as the main entry point. Content data is stored in separate files within the include directory.

HTML Structure: The website uses HTML structure and fetches variable data using PHP arrays from other files. Functions are used to populate content based on the accessed location.

CSS: The design utilizes three main CSS files: nav, style, and start.

JavaScript: Currently, JavaScript is not actively used in the project.

Design Updates (The Anti-Virus page under software is the only item that works currently.)

This section could explain your approach to improving the website's look and feel.

Next Steps
Structure backups, and all the pages inside menu Jesus Christ.
Build a gallery like the test environment, maybe we can randomize the thumbnail images, and paste them on a side bar.
The gallery page will also an introduction to the gallery in a main bar.
Then when a user clicks on an image the image link take the user to the location of the image in relation to its position inside the gallery.
Under the full screen image a carrousel of more images.
each image will have different versions of the image to save memory.
